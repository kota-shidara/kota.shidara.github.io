                Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the Okuma Trophy. In a short time, 9 great speakers will deliver their speeches. Please turn off your smart phone and enjoy the show. Thank you. …Hmm, I’m sorry but there seem to be about 10 minutes before Ms. Hinako Ueki gets ready… Well, OK, let me give you a short talk. That’s it. No big deal. Just one message.
              </p>
              <p class="speech-script-text">
                My short talk starts with small questions. 1, when you go to Tokyo Disney Resort, why do you go? Yeah, of course to enjoy! 2, when you go to a pancake shop, why? Yes, for “Insuta-Bae”. 3, now you are here in the Okuma trophy, why did you come? You may have come to deliver your speech, to organize the contest, to cheer up your friends or to learn about speeches…right? Yes, they are valid reasons. But are these it? Are these all of the reasons why you spend your precious holiday and come to this contest? Today, in this 8 minutes, let’s think together about the reason why you came here, and reconsider the meaning of speech contests.
              </p>
              <div class="is-hidden" data-accordion-target="speech01">
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  It was when I became a speaker that I began to feel something was wrong.  Fortunately, I was able to deliver my speech in several contests as a finalist.  After my speech, my friends told me “Your speech was great!”  I was glad to hear that, but it was just about my speech itself.  I didn’t feel that I changed people around me.  And I think I’m not alone when I say this.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Let me talk about my survey to show you the reality of ESS speech.  I asked 29 people who have listened to one famous and “strong” ESS speech.  In one part of the speech, the speaker suggested that audience should google a certain phrase on the spot, just googling, which everyone was able to.  But the result showed that out of 29, just 5 took action.  5 out of 29, this is the reality.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  When you consider the reason why you are not moved, it is easily said that “the speech was not persuasive enough”.  Sometimes it’s true since they are not judged as persuasive on an absolute scale.  But on a relative scale, they are.  Today’s speeches are at least, top 10 speeches among all.  And since the speakers have already prepared and memorized them, it’s no use saying something to them in order to improve today’s contest.  Therefore, rather than speakers, I focused on our attitude.  Dear audience, I mean everyone in this hall, we need to rethink the reason why we came here today.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  In order to answer the question, let’s think about why human beings make speeches.  Why Martin Luther King, Jr. said “I have a dream.”?  Why Emma Watson posed a question about women’s rights at the UN?  It was because they wanted to deliver their ideas, change the audience and change the world.  Now, I have a question for everyone in this hall.  If it applies to you, please raise your hand, no, please stand up!  When you deliver your own speech, do you try to change the audience, to realize your ideal situation or to change the world?  Thank you!  Look around!  OK, please sit down.  … And when your back touched your seat, some of you became passive.  You might be and have been the “passive audience”, aren’t you?
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  But from your experience as a speaker and as you looked around, you know that speakers are passionate.  The problem is that we are not Steve Jobs or Barack Obama, but we are just university students learning speeches.  So, sometimes we fail in making them persuasive and you feel bored.  And that’s why I deliver this speech.  I totally agree that speakers are responsible in inspiring the audience.  But even so, there is something that the audience can do.  Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to try to change yourself.  And I want you to be an “active audience”.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Now I hope everyone has reconsidered the reason why you came here, and has found one more reason: to change yourself by being an active audience.  Active audiences try to accept the idea, and put it into practice.  But I know there is one argument, “whether one is inspired or not depends on his/her heart and occurs automatically, so no matter how hard one tries to be inspired, sometimes it’s difficult.”  Yes, it’s true, so what I want to say is “dear active audience, keep being active after the 8 minutes.”  Let me explain about this.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  According to Aristotle, an ancient Greek psychologist, there are three factors when people are inspired.  One, “Logos” or how logical the speech is.  Two, “Pathos” or how passionate the speech is.  But as for these two factors, there is nothing the audience can do, they are completely speakers’ jobs.  Three, “ethos”.  This factor relates to the speaker’s personality, for example, “Can I trust him?” or “Does she speak from the bottom of her heart?”  As for this factor, you can foster by being active in the contest.  For instance, by talking with the speaker, you can touch their heart.  If you discuss with the speaker, your impression of the speech will be more vivid.  Actually, this is scientifically proven by American national training laboratories.  Speech contests should not be one directional, but should be dual directional, and what is important here is the activeness of the audience.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Speech contests is like sowing.  Every speaker plants seeds in your mind.  Whether you grow them or not depends on you.  But I believe a flower bed with colorful blooms looks more beautiful…  Ladies and gentlemen, please think again, why did you come here?  Let’s be an active audience.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Now the speakers seem to be ready, so please actively enjoy the Okuma trophy.  Thank you.

                “Everyone, now the class is over. Homework is page 12. 　So, see you next week!” I work part-time at a cram school and I really like this job. However, I also need to do extra tasks like supplementary lessons, grading test papers, inputting scores, copying handouts, cleaning the room and so on. I knew I had the responsibility to do these tasks, but one strange thing decreased my motivation. That was the pay system in my workplace. When conducting the classes, I was paid around 2,000 yen per hour. And for all extra tasks, I was paid a fixed 500 yen. No matter how long I worked, this 500 yen didn’t go up. I would say in my heart “Oh…I don’t have time to prepare for tomorrow’s test at university because of these NO-PAY tasks”. But for a long time, I accepted this system.
              </p>
              <p class="speech-script-text">
                In this hall, there are a lot of workers, especially part-time workers. Some of you may have unclear points in your working condition but remain silent since you don’t know what to do. Or perhaps, you do not even realize that you are treated incorrectly. So today, in my speech, I will share the knowledge about the labor law with you, so please rethink about your job. Then, showing my experience, I want to create a new choice in your mind, that is “raising your voice”.
              </p>
              <div class="is-hidden" data-accordion-target="speech02">
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  First of all, let me show you one piece of data.  2 years ago, Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare took a survey on part-time workers.  There were checklists, for example, “Are you paid for cleaning time?”  And the result shows about 60% of part-time workers have experienced incorrect treatment.  60%!  That’s more than a half.  Now you may wonder “What is our right supported by the labor law?”  OK, the following is the answer.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Of course, it is illegal to make people work for a pay lower than the minimum wage.  Even if your overtime pay is fixed, if you work longer than that, then you can get additional pay.  And the definition of working time is when you are under the control of your employer, so it includes the time when you change from your clothes into the uniform.  And also, it should be calculated by the minute, not by 15 minutes or 30 minutes.  Furthermore, you can demand unpaid salary for the last 2 years.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  There might have been some points that you did not know before.  Knowing is the first step.  But for a long time, I did not know, so I had not realized that I had the right to demand the pay.  But when I read an article about labor law, I made a breakthrough.  I then, collected more information by the Internet and e-mail, and I took the next step.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Last march, I had a meeting in my workplace.  At the end of the meeting, I raised my hand and asked gently about the pay system.  “I like this cram school, but if we go on like this with the current system, we might be in danger, since it’s similar to the other school’s accused case.  What do you think?”  The branch manager replied “Umm…I’m sorry but I cannot explain this system rationally.  I will report to headquarters.”  One month later, in another meeting, the branch manager said to the workers, “I admit that our pay system was not clear.  And so, from today, we will correctly pay for supplementary lessons.”  To tell the truth, I was not fully content with this result but I felt happy.  Even though the problem was not solved completely, it certainly improved.  At that time, I noticed the power of a voice.  Ladies and gentlemen, I want all of you to have this idea, “no voice, no change”.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Now I know you think, “No Voice, No Change?  Cool.  But I am not so courageous enough to say…”  Actually, me either.  So, in order to have the courage, you need to have two things.  Evidence that your knowledge is correct and sense of support from the experts.  There are some NPOs that solve many problems.  The other day, I actually used one of them, named POSSE, to get some information and to confirm that I was correct.  It helped me a lot!  You can find it on the Internet and can contact them via e-mail.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Some of you might fear that raising your voice may damage the human relationship with your manager.  But in my case, nothing happened between my manager and me.  Quite the contrary, I was thanked.  Yes, it might be true that my case was lucky, yet I don’t think this is a very rare case.  Why not give it a try?  And if you are turned down, you can ask the Labor Standards Office or NPO for help.  Actually, in the case of “Sゼミナール”, they were turned down twice.  But with the support of NPO, finally they made it.  Remember, the relationship between your friends and your manager should be separated.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Having said that, I know some of you still face a high hurdle.  Then, why not start from your close colleague, not directly to your manager?  You can gradually spread your voice and your small voice might grow into a big one.  The basic idea is the same, “no voice, no change”.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Now I told you everything that I wanted to tell.  Now you know you have the right, and now you know how I want you to behave.  Here I want to make it clear that I don’t force you to take action.  Yet at least, I want you to have the choice of raising your voice.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Some people criticize me as an idealist, saying “The reality is not that easy.  Japan is the nation of conformity!”  Yes, I know, but I want to challenge it.  I hope my speech will spread all across Japan and contribute to create a society in which everyone can easily assert their right.

                I have some questions. If your answer is yes, please raise your hand. Do you treasure your friends? …OK, I see many hands. How about money? …Yeah, we have to save. And do you treasure “today”? I believe most of you do not want to waste your one day, so you try to live as actively as possible. And you may feel a sense of fulfillment when you go to bed. Don’t you, busy men and women?
              </p>
              <p class="speech-script-text">
                Actually, I was the kind of parson who misunderstood that I cherished each single day.　But one time, I noticed the existence of a strong enemy against it, named “forgetfulness”. Today, I would like to share my experience and tell you what I started to fight against the enemy. After my speech, you will start a new life in which you cherish today, your past, and your future.
              </p>
              <div class="is-hidden" data-accordion-target="speech03">
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Here is my experience.  After entering college, I started making a speech and I participated in some speech contests.  Before the contest I thought “I made a great speech so the first prize must come to me!”  But actually, I could not win in any speech contests.  I was disappointed at the results and decided to make a great effort.  However, two weeks later, I forgot my decision and my motivation had declined.  You may have similar experiences like me.  For example, after each test, you declare “In the next semester, I will start studying earlier.”  But actually, you don’t.  Or maybe you have been scolded by your mother, “Hey, how many times do I have to say the same thing!?”  Even though we learn something and we feel something, it goes somewhere, and we waste the day.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Then, what prevents us from cherishing our precious one day?  Yes, the answer is “forgetfulness”.  Human being is often said as a creature of forgetfulness.  As the forgetting curve shows, our memory declines as time passes.  Moreover, even our strong feelings gradually get vague.  How greatly we feel happy, sad, or how strongly we make up our mind, those feelings gradually lose their vividness.  Ladies and gentlemen, isn’t it wonderful if we can overcome this human’s limitation?  This is what I started after my failure.  “Keeping a diary”.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Just before going to bed, open your diary.  Look back on the day from morning till night, and write down what you did, what you learned, and what you felt.  That’s it.  How simple it is!
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Let me introduce my own diary to show you one precious page in my life.  “November 2nd 2016.  I was elected chief of the speech section.  I feel excited and nervous.  Can I win in speech contests?  Can I make good relationships with section members especially with girls?  But I will do my best.  I will be close to all members.  I must study speech more.  Even if I cannot win, I will do what I can do.”  That day is one of the days which I do not want to and must not forget.  Sometimes my motivation declines, but this page always reminds me of my determination.  You must have days which are special to you or days when you make an important decision.  A diary stores your emotion and provides you a chance to reflect on those precious days.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Now I hope you understood the wonderful aspect of keeping a diary.  Actually, about 17% of Japanese people write in a diary every day, according to the survey by Asahi group holdings.  But I want every person to write in a diary every day.  Not only special days but each and every day.  If you have the habit of recording every day, you can look back on what you learned and store it in your diary on that day.  This is important, by keeping a diary you get an opportunity to look back on and store the day’s fruits.  And these fruits should include not only what you did but what you learned, felt and decided.  Nowadays some people use Twitter or Facebook to record their days.  However, since they are “for someone”, not “for you”, you may　exaggerate the facts or hide your straight emotion.  In contrast, your diary always welcomes your true feelings.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  For those who cannot continue writing.  Let’s lower the hurdle of writing.  Only one sentence?  OK.  You forgot to write yesterday?  Do not mind and restart from today.  Be relaxed and enjoy it.  Diary is not something heavy, but your enjoyable friend.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  One year has passed since I started to write.  Since my diary is three-year diary, there are three divided areas for 2016, 2017, and 2018.  Every time I open my diary at night, I can read the record of my life one year ago.  Reading the record, the scenery spreads in front of me and I recall what I thought on that day.  The day’s fruits will never be wasted, and each day contributes to create my brighter future.  Don’t you think it wonderful?!
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Today, you hear wonderful, inspiring speeches.  But if you just hear the speeches and take no action after that, you may easily forget them.  Start from today, catch and store today’s tips, do not miss them.  Then you can treasure today and take the first step to your brighter future.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Future and past.  We can change our future but cannot change our past.  We cannot learn from our future but can learn from our past.  Today, yesterday, the day before yesterday…all of these become past and should be reflected in order to create our brighter future.  The first step is to cherish today.  Let’s record your life!

              <p class="speech-script-text">
                Hello, ladies and gentlemen. (Audiences reply, “Hello”.) Hello! (Audiences reply, “Hello!”) Hello!! (Audiences reply, “Hello!!”) Thank you for your kind response to me, and today, I’d like to talk about it. “Response”.
              </p>
              <p class="speech-script-text">
                Let me ask you one question. Can you respond? Do you have the ability to respond to others? Well, you will answer proudly, “Yes, I can!” It’s true. I believe most of the people here have their eyes, ears, mouths and brains. Yes, you are able to respond. When I say hello to you, your eyes see my mouth, your ears catch my voice, and your brains command your mouths to say “Hello”. But when it comes to online communication, for example LINE groups, you are divided into two groups: those who can respond and those who cannot. In other words, those who have response ability and those who don’t have response ability.
              </p>
              <div class="is-hidden" data-accordion-target="speech04">
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  It was when I was a chief of the speech section that I suffered from response troubles.  Since I was the leader of the group, I had a lot of times to post messages on LINE group.  For example, “Those who will go to summer camp, please stamp on the note.” or “I’m planning to hold brain-storming party, so can you guys tell me your schedule?”  I typed those messages and pushed a send button.  And then…silence.  The number of “read” continued to increase but no one responded me on the spot.  I didn’t ask them to reply quickly until the deadline was actually coming.  But somehow, gradually, I lost my confidence as a leader by these no-reaction phenomena.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  I’m not sure whether or not you feel sympathy for me, and some of you might laugh at me saying, “You have the mental of glass?”.  But for leaders or those who propose something on groups, the members’ response is very important and is something they pay attention to.  If there is no response, we cannot tell how members felt, and moreover, we feel that they are turning down our proposal, and even us ourselves.  Thus, we are eager to get a “good response”.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  At the same time, I believe group members have responsibility to make it a good unit.  Your behaviors have influence on the leader or other members.  And in order to live up to your responsibility, you need to cultivate your response ability.  Yes, you need to have a response ability to fulfill your responsibility.  Ladies and gentlemen, now I’m going to tell you just one tip which will increase your response ability.  One tip that I want you to keep in mind when you respond.  That is “quickness” of your response.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Quickness.  Please respond as soon as you see the post.  For instance, when someone makes a schedule adjustment, please answer it on the spot.  When someone posts a question, please reply to it as soon as you see it.  Check your phone regularly and reply when you see the message notification.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Some of you might say, “I’m busy… so, it’s hard for me to reply quickly.”  But wait.  Probably, it’s not the matter of time, but the matter of your mindset.  Most of the time, you actually have enough time to reply, like 30 seconds, but you just are not willing to reply, since the priority of response is lower in yourself.  So now I’m going to tell you how important it is to respond quickly, and raise your priority of response.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Quick response creates trust.  According to Judy Olson, the professor of University of California, people judge the trust-worthiness of others over text-based communication largely by the quickness of their response.  She said that since we cannot use the normal indicators, such as facial expressions or intonation, quick response is the best way to build the trust.  Also, Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of google said “There are people who can respond quickly to emails, and those who cannot. Strive to be the former.  Most of the greatest - and busiest - people we know act quickly on their emails, not just to us, but to everyone.”  Besides these two people, there are many people who claim the importance of quick response.  Quick response can create trust, and is very useful in business situation.  No matter how busy you are, always make efforts to respond quickly.
                </p>
                <p class="speech-script-text">
                  Response ability leads to fulfill your responsibility.  If you belong to some groups, you have responsibility to make them good units.  In order to do so, you need to keep in mind just one tip, quickness.  Your responsibility, your response ability.  I want you to keep this in mind, and make efforts to contribute to the groups where you belong.
